In simple words, it is an optimization over plain recursion.

The idea is to reuse the solutions of subproblems when there are overlapping subproblems.

Two ways to implement DP:
1. Memoization(Top Down)
2. Tabulization(Bottom Up)

Applications of DP:
1. Bellman Ford ALgorithm : Shortest Path from source to destination
2. Floyd Warshall
3. Diff Utility(LCS) 
4. Search Closed Words(Edit Distance)
5. Resource Allocation(0-1 Knapsack)
